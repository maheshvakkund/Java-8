DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAMBDA EXPRESSION AND ANONYMOUS INNER CLASS:

ANONYMOUS INNER CLASS                                                                               

1)Anonymous inner class is a CLASS without name.
2)Anonymous inner class can extend Abstract and Concrete classes.
3)Anonymous inner class can extend an interface that contains ANY number of methods.
4)Inside Anonymous inner class we can declare instance variable.
5)Anonymous inner class CAN BE instantiated.
6)Inside Anonymous inner class THIS KEYWORD always refers to Current Anonymous Inner class Object but not outer class.
7)Best choice if we want to handle multiple methods.
8)For Anonymous inner class a seperate class file will be generated at the time of compilation.
9)Memory will be allocated on demand when we are creating object.

LAMBDA EXPRESSION

1)Lambda Expression is a FUNCTION without name .                                                                                        
2)Lambda Expression can extend Abstract and Concrete classes.
3)Lambda Expression can extend an interface that contains ONLY ONE method.
4)Inside Lambda Expression  we can't declare instance variable ,whatever variable are considered as local variable.
5)Lambda Expression CANNOT BE instantiated.
6)Inside Lambda Expression THIS KEYWORD always refers to Current  outer class object. 
7)Best choice if we want to handle SINGLE ABSTRACT METHOD.
8)For Lambda Expression  a seperate class file will not  be generated at the time of compilation.
9)Will reside in Method area of JVM.
